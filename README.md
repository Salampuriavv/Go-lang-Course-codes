Introduction
This repository serves as a logbook for my Golang learning journey. I aim to consistently update the codebase to reflect my daily progress, sharing insights, challenges, and new knowledge gained along the way. Feel free to explore the code, offer suggestions, or use it as a reference for your own learning journey.

Daily Progress
Day 1: 
Learned about basic Go syntax
Implemented a simple "Hello, World!" program
Explored variable declarations and data types
Day 2: 
Covered control flow structures (if statements, loops)
Practiced using arrays and slices
Started working on a small project to reinforce concepts
